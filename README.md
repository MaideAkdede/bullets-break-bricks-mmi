![Sort of space invaders game view](./view.png)

Game still to improve:
- add a `controller` object
- make the possibility to `hit` space and arrows at same time
- make a Class instead of an object for the `brick`
- add some colors maybe (too dull)
- add some states to the game (start, end, levels maybe)
- add the possibility to change the number of row and column from the html
